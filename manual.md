# Diver for the PICO-8
_Created by Cooper Dalrymple, 2021_

## Introduction

Just off the coast of a deserted caribbean island, a lone adventurer yearns for fame and fortune. They were told not to dive into the dangerous caves of this forgotten island, but that further stoked the fire within our protagonist. Having recently discovered an ancient tome of unknown decent, they will descend willingly into the menacing yet enticing depths below. With your help, they may be the one to discover something incredible... or they may forever perish.

## Controls

Diver is a one-player game, so only one controller is supported at a time. You can play Diver using all of the supported PICO-8 controllers. The most simple way of playing is by using a computer keyboard. You can check the keybindings using the command "keyconfig" within the PICO-8 command line. Press Esc at any point to enter the command line.

### Swimming

To make your character swim around the map, use the d-pad on your controller (arrows keys on keyboard) in the direction that you'd like to go. Any items you have will activate in the direction you're facing.

### Inventory

In order to use items after you've picked them up, press "o" to open your inventory. With your inventory open, you can press "x" to change your selection. The current item you've selected will appear with a filled in circle rather than an outline. You can also have no item selected. Once you're ready, press "o" again to continue the game. The item you've selected should appear in the upper-left corner to the right of your coin count. If the item has a quantity, it will be displayed to the right of the item.

### Shop

To access the shop, you must be within the area of a designated shop zone. This includes the boat at the beginning of the game, but there are other shop areas to find as you dive further in. Press the "o" button to open the shop dialog. You will be given three options to pick from: "life", "harpoon", and "bomb". If you are not yet able to purchase one of these options, it will appear greyed out and you won't be able to select it. To select an item to purchase, press the "x" button until a red dot appears next to the desired item. To purchase it, press the "o" button once again. This will remove 5 coins from your inventory. If you don't have enough coins, the transaction will be canceled. If you purchase "life", your hearts will be fully replenished. If you purchase "harpoon" or "bomb", you will receive 5 of that item up to the maximum amount you can carry.

## Items

There are a many items scattered throughout the game. Use them to your advantage to help you delve further under the ocean surface.

### Chests

Scattered throughout the world, there are a number of underwater chests. These differ from floating items because they will give you a larger reward or extend the maximum amount you can carry of an item. Floating items will only add to your inventory by 1 and be limited to their maximum.

### Breathing Tube

As you move around, you will notice the bar at the top-center of the screen changing. This is a meter of the amount of breathing tube you are using. When you dive deeper into the depths below, your breathing tube will keep you attached to the boat at the beginning of the game. You may find that it will keep you from progressing further if you run out of cord. Make sure to look around for more lengths of cord to extend your breathing tube and therefore how far you can explore.

### Coins

Everyone loves money! And there's plenty of it to be found in the depths below. You can use the coins you collect in the shops throughout the map to replenish your inventory. There is no limit to the number of coins you can collect.

### Hearts

You begin the game with only 3 hearts at your disposal. Any time you receive damage from an enemy or dangerous environment, you will lose 1 heart. If you lose your last heart, you will perish and will have to start again from the beginning. You can replenish your health by finding floating hearts or uncovering a chest with a heart within it to gain an extra heart.

### Swimming Flippers

Flippers are a great way to increase your speed underwater. If you pick up a set within a chest or floating around, your speed will increase.

### Keys

You will doubtlessly find a number of locked doors below the water's surface leading to unknown locations. Every door must have a key! You can use these keys to unlock doors and open the way to new discoveries.

### Harpoons

There are a number of dangerous creatures lurking below just waiting for a tasty human treat. These trusty harpoons are a great way to show them who's boss! When you use a harpoon, it will fire straight ahead of you with great speed. Use it to attack enemies who are far away.

### Bombs

These can be a great tool to clear debris found below and uncover hidden secrets. Their explosion can be quite deadly too! Just make sure to back away quickly before a bomb goes off. And be careful, because bombs will go off immediately when they come in contact with a dangerous creature.

### Dagger

This relic of an unknown time has seen better days. It no longer has the shine or edge that it once had. It may still prove useful to smaller enemies. When you use a dagger, it will attack within a small area just in front of you. You'll need to get close, but not too close!

### Unknown Artifact

This artifact immediately sparked your curiousity. There must be some knowledge in the depths below which would hint at this artifact's existance. Currently, it serves you no purpose, but that may change...

### Enviro Suit

This highly advanced wearable technology will protect you under the rising pressure and temperature of the depths below. You'll have to find it first before you venture too far. Once equipped, you will wear it for the rest of your journey.

## Enemies

Scattered throughout the oceanic rock are a number of creatures which stand in your way of discovering the riches beneath. You may be able to avoid a number of them, but at some point, you'll have to use the tools at your disposal to clear the way.

### Urchin

These creatures will keep to themselves for the most part, but their prickly spines may harm the most foolish of adventurers. It may be a good idea to take care of them to clear the path.

### Fish

Mindlessly swimming around, the typical fish won't cause you too much harm... That is unless you get in their way. Keep out of their path, and if they're blocking yours, do what must be done.

### Squid

The humble squid can be quite graceful as it takes great strides with the wake of the water. Timid as they are, they may still attack you if you draw near. There are rumours of larger squid possessing unique abilities.

### Angler Fish

Trapped within the lonely confines of the ocean depths, these fish grow hungry for the next meal. If they see you, they may charge! It'll take quite a few blows to take out this angry beast.
